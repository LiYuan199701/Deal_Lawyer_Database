11:04:21 From Albert Yoon to Everyone : This dataset combines raw counts for first/given names of male and female babies in those time periods, and then calculates a probability for a name given the aggregate count.
11:10:12 From Tracey George (Vanderbilt) to Everyone : If name appears twice, then use gender for higher count.
11:10:21 From Tracey George (Vanderbilt) to Everyone : If name appears once, use gender.
11:12:35 From Tracey George (Vanderbilt) to Everyone : If name appears twice, use gender if one gender is at least 75% of all observations.  If Albert appears 1000 times and the person is male at least 750 times, then code as male
11:12:57 From Tracey George (Vanderbilt) to Everyone : If Albert appears 1000 times and the person is male 60 times, then code as "unclear".
11:14:16 From Tracey George (Vanderbilt) to Everyone : If Albert appears 1000 times and the person is male 600 times (or any number between 500 and 749), then code as unclear
